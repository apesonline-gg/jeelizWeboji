1. Create a base morph and 11 additional morphs as .obj files. Put them in a directory under `meshConverter/meshes`
2. Run the build morphs binary against the directory you created. The json files will be placed in `assets`
3. Use something like npm [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) and serve `tutorial/index.html`
